# ApprenticeVR: VRSrc Edition

**ApprenticeVR: VRSrc Edition** is a modern, cross-platform desktop app built with Electron, React, and TypeScript for managing and sideloading content onto Meta Quest devices. It connects to a community game library, handles downloads and installs automatically, and lets you contribute games back to the library.

> **Fork note:** This fork includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. See the section below for details.

---

## Step 1: Download the Right File for Your OS

| File | Platform | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-x64.dmg` | macOS | Intel native; Apple Silicon (M1–M5): install Rosetta 2 first — `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-setup-x64.exe` | Windows Installer | Recommended for most users |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-portable-x64.exe` | Windows Portable | No install required |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage` | Linux x64 | Works on most distros |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-arm64.AppImage` | Linux ARM64 | For ARM-based systems (fixed in v2.2.8) |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-amd64.deb` | Debian/Ubuntu x64 | Install with dpkg |
| `apprenticevr-x.x.x-arm64.deb` | Debian/Ubuntu ARM64 | ARM version (fixed in v2.2.8) |

> Downloads are on the Releases page. Always use the latest version.

> **macOS note:** Only an x64 DMG is provided. Apple Silicon (M1–M5) users should install Rosetta 2 (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`) and run the x64 build — it works fine.

### macOS Fix: "App is damaged"

```
xattr -c /Applications/ApprenticeVR\ VRSrc\ Edition.app
```

### Linux AppImage

```
chmod +x apprenticevr-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage
./apprenticevr-x.x.x-x86_64.AppImage
```

### Building from Source

**macOS:**
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx electron-vite build && npx electron-builder --mac --x64
```

**Linux:**
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx electron-vite build && npx electron-builder --linux --x64
```

**Windows:**
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx electron-vite build && npx electron-builder --win --x64
```

---

## Step 2: Get Your Server Credentials

ApprenticeVR requires:

- `baseUri` (URL ending in `/`)
- `password` (base64 encoded)

Where to find them:

- Telegram: https://t.me/the_vrSrc
- Web preview: https://t.me/s/the_vrSrc
- Public JSON: https://qpmegathread.top/pages/public-json.html

Keep credentials private. Do not share them.

---

## Step 3: Enter Credentials

### Option A: In-App (Recommended)

1. Open Settings
2. Click **Set Public Server JSON**
3. Paste JSON or enter values manually
4. Click **Save**

### Option B: ServerInfo.json

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\apprenticevr\ServerInfo.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/apprenticevr/ServerInfo.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/apprenticevr/ServerInfo.json` |

```
{"baseUri":"https://your-url-here/","password":"your-password-here"}
```

Restart required when using this method.

---

## Step 4: Connect Quest and Sideload

1. Plug in headset via USB
2. Allow USB Debugging
3. Device appears in app
4. Download games

Up to 5 downloads run in parallel.

---

## What's New in VRSrc Edition

### v2.2.8

- **install.txt support** — games that ship with an `install.txt` now have their ADB commands read and executed line-by-line instead of the standard APK+OBB flow
- **ZIP direct install** — drop a ZIP into the manual install picker; the app extracts it, processes `install.txt` if present, installs APK and OBB, then cleans up automatically
- **Local upload fix** — the upload service now reads `upload.config` from your local VRP data folder instead of fetching from a remote URL
- **ARM64 Linux binaries fixed** — x86_64 binaries were being bundled in ARM64 AppImages; a real ARM64 static 7zip binary is now included, and adb falls back to the system-installed `adb` (Google does not ship ARM64 Linux platform-tools)
- **Translation improvements** — additional UI components now respect the selected language

### Key Improvements (all versions)

- **Local file upload** — upload game folders or ZIP files directly from your PC without a connected Quest
- **Spanish (Castellano) language** — auto-detected from your OS; switch anytime in Settings
- Fixed YouTube embeds using Electron webview
- 5 parallel downloads instead of 1
- Switched from `rclone mount` to `rclone copy`
- Added pause and resume support
- Prevented ADB install conflicts with queue system
- Major UI and performance optimizations
- Fixed download progress and ETA display
- Improved handling of large game libraries (2600+ titles)
- Fixed resume pipeline logic
- Fixed download path duplication bug
- Improved resume progress tracking
- Reduced build size from 478MB to 110MB
- Dynamic game list file detection
- Redesigned mirror management UI
- Simplified update notification system
- Removed 0KB placeholder file issues
- Version now visible in Settings
- Upload pipeline fixed and working

## Uploading Games

### From a Connected Quest (automatic)

The app detects games on your device that are missing from or newer than the library and prompts you to upload them.

1. Create staging folder
2. Pull APK via ADB
3. Check for OBB files
4. Pull OBB if present
5. Generate metadata
6. Compress into ZIP
7. Upload via rclone
8. Add to blacklist

### From Local Files (manual)

Use **Uploads → Upload Local Files** to send game folders or ZIP archives directly from your PC.

- Each folder must contain **exactly one APK** file — OBB folders, instruction files, and other content are included automatically
- If you already have a ZIP, it is sent as-is
- Multiple folders/ZIPs can be queued at once and upload one at a time with live progress

> Requires at least one successful VRP connection so that `upload.config` is written locally.

Uploads do not guarantee inclusion.

## Planned Feature

Scanning headset for:

- Newer versions than library
- Missing games

Uses ADB version comparison and game list indexing.

## Logs

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\apprenticevr\logs\main.log` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Logs/apprenticevr/main.log` |
| Linux | `~/.config/apprenticevr/logs/main.log` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Check baseUri format
- Verify password
- Ensure correct line endings
- Try different DNS
- Use VPN if needed

### Quest Not Detected

- Use data cable
- Allow USB debugging
- Check antivirus interference
- Try different ports

### macOS Fix

```
xattr -c /Applications/ApprenticeVR\ VRSrc\ Edition.app
```

### Linux Fix

```
chmod +x apprenticevr-*.AppImage && ./apprenticevr-*.AppImage
```

### ARM64 Linux: adb not found

Install adb from your package manager:

```
sudo apt install adb           # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo pacman -S android-tools   # Arch
```
